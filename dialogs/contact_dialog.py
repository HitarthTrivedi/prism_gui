"""Contact the team — the last tier of Help & support: an actual person.

No ticketing system and no web form on purpose. Email is the one channel
every customer already has open, that works from a factory office with a
strict firewall, and that leaves them holding a copy of what they sent.

Why the conversation becomes the email: by the time somebody reaches this
sheet they have already told the help screen what is wrong, what they tried
and what did not work. Making them type it a second time into an empty mail
window is how a support request turns into "it doesn't work" plus a
screenshot, which costs two more round trips to unpick. So the sheet arrives
pre-filled with the transcript and the version and licence details, and they
can delete whatever they do not want to send.

Three ways out, because `mailto:` is not reliable everywhere — a machine
with no mail client configured silently does nothing, and a customer who
presses a button that appears to do nothing concludes the whole feature is
broken. Copy and Save always work.
