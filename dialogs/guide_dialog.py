"""The guide — what Prism can do, for someone who has never used AI.

Not documentation. Documentation describes features; this answers the two
questions a first-time user actually has, in this order:

    "What is this for?"        — one paragraph, no jargon
    "What do I type?"          — real examples they can copy

Every section ends with something they can press, because reading about a
thing and finding it are different problems and the second one is where
people give up.

Written at the level of someone who runs a fabrication shop or a marketing
agency and has never used ChatGPT. No word appears here that they would have
to look up: not "prompt", not "pipeline", not "LLM", not "agent" — Prism's own
screens say "tool" and "step", and so does this.

Locked add-ons still appear, greyed, with what they do. That is deliberate:
this is the only place a customer can find out what else Prism does, and a
list with holes in it teaches them nothing.
