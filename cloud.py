"""Cloud drives that are already on the filesystem.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why this exists instead of the Google Drive API
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The obvious way to let someone attach a file from their Drive is the Google
Picker: the chooser you see inside Gmail. It looks credential-free. It is not
— it runs on an OAuth access token, and there is no way to read a person's
Drive without one. That means a Google Cloud project, a published consent
screen, a client ID shipped in the build, and refresh tokens that expire every
seven days until the screen is out of Testing. All of that, to open a file.

Google Drive for Desktop makes the whole problem disappear. It mounts the
user's Drive as an ordinary folder — on macOS at
~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-<email>/My Drive, on Windows usually G:\\.
The files are simply there, under the account they are already signed into,
with Google's own sync client keeping them fresh and Google's own permissions
deciding what they can see. Prism does not need a token, a scope, or a consent
screen to open a file that is already on the disk.

So this module does the small, reliable thing: find those mounts, name them,
and offer them as places to attach from. `integrations/gdrive.py` (the OAuth
route) stays available for anyone who has not installed Drive for Desktop, but
it is no longer the way in.

What this buys, beyond the missing setup:
  · nothing expires — no seven-day reconnection
  · no cap on users, no consent screen review
  · the account is whichever one they are signed into, which is what they
    expect "my Drive" to mean
  · OneDrive, Dropbox and iCloud come free, because they mount the same way

The limitation, stated plainly: a file that is online-only (Drive's "stream"
mode keeps placeholders, not contents) is downloaded by the OS on first read.
That is a pause, not a failure, and it is the same pause Finder gives them.
