"""The body stack's order is the screen table's order, and it is checked.

main_window.SCREENS declares the pages of the body stack. The integers, the
name->index lookup and the index->name lookup are all derived from it, so
those three can no longer disagree.

What a table cannot do by itself is guarantee that the pages were actually
ADDED in that order. `screens.addWidget(...)` assigns the index by call
position, and before this file the only thing keeping the calls in step with
the constants was a trailing comment on each line:

    self.screens.addWidget(self.gerber_panel)          # GERBER
    self.screens.addWidget(self.wizard_panel)          # WIZARD

Get that wrong -- insert a page rather than append one, or reorder two
during a refactor -- and every screen after it shifts by one. Nothing
raises. The rail lights the wrong row, clicking Gerber shows Support, and
the suite is perfectly green because no test ever asked which widget was on
which page.

That is the whole reason this file exists, and it matters more during the
add-ons migration than at any other time: panels are about to move between
modules, and a move is exactly when an addWidget call gets dropped or
re-ordered.
