"""The Email add-on's front door — addons/email/panel.py::EmailPanel.

Before this, EmailSetupDialog only ever opened itself the first time, from
MainWindow._open_email_dialog(), which is guarded by
`not CB.mailer.is_configured(self.cfg)`. Once an account was configured there
was no button, menu, or gesture anywhere on screen that reopened it — a wrong
password or a mailbox change had no way in short of hand-editing the config
file. This defends the fix: a standing "Change account" action that opens the
same dialog regardless of whether one is already set up.
