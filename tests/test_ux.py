"""Does a first-time user get told what to do?

The product goal these defend: a business owner who has never used AI should
be able to resolve an ordinary problem without telephoning anyone. That means
two properties, and both are easy to lose by accident:

  · every failure they can meet is TRANSLATED — no HTTP codes, no exception
    class names, no "selector", "driver" or "token" on screen;
  · every message carries a NEXT ACTION. A message with no action is a phone
    call, so an entry with no steps is a bug in the copy.
