"""Where a shipped Prism looks for its own updates.

These two strings are compiled into every binary ever released, and there is
no override of any kind -- not an environment variable, not a config file,
and deliberately not anything the licence server can say. `updater.py` states
the reason: "never overridable at runtime in a frozen build, and never a
value taken from a server response". A server that can redirect the update
channel is a server that can be made to ship a different program.

That makes them the most consequential constants in the repository, and
until this file **no test asserted either value**. tests/test_updater.py
checks only that `download_url()` agrees with `app_meta.DOWNLOAD_URL` -- so
both could be wrong together and the suite would stay green.

What being wrong costs
──────────────────────
Nothing visible, which is the problem. A 404 from the wrong repository is
caught by `except Exception: return None` in `_fetch_manifest` (the comment
there reads "no network is routine"), which `check_for_update()` returns as
"no update available", which `workers.py` turns into the `none` signal,
which `main_window` handles by opening `download_url()` in a browser -- the
same wrong repository's releases page.

So: no in-app error, no log line, nothing reported anywhere. Every installed
copy silently stops updating, and the first person to find out is a customer
who eventually notices they are several versions behind. There is no way to
fix it from the server afterwards, because the fix would have to already be
in the binary that is asking.

Why this is not paranoia about a value nobody edits
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
The add-ons restructure moved 13 files and rewrote imports across ~40 more.
A rename pass that touched `updater.py`'s string, or a well-meant
find-and-replace of the repository name during a fork or a transfer, would
change it, and every other test in this suite would still pass.
