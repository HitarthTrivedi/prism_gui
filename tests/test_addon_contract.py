"""The add-on boundaries, as tests rather than as a convention.

`docs/architecture/06-addons.md` has always described how an add-on is
wired -- rail entry, launcher, licence gate, dialog, worker, engine call
through core_bridge. It described it as a RECIPE, six steps to follow by
hand, and hand-wiring is why the same fact ended up written in seven tables
that disagree.

This file is the recipe made checkable. Each test pins one rule, and each
one is here because breaking it fails somewhere expensive: at release, in
CI, or in front of a customer in a windowed build with no console.

Note what is NOT tested yet. Nothing consumes the registry at this stage --
it exists, it is proven to reproduce the live tables exactly, and the
rewiring is a separate commit so that reverting one is not reverting both.
The tests that only make sense after the rewiring (no shell module imports
an add-on; no module keeps a private add-on table) arrive with it.
