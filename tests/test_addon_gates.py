"""Every add-on stays behind its licence, whatever file it lives in.

The gate is a separate line of code from the thing it guards:

    def _open_gerber(self):
        self._authorized_then("boq", "addon", lambda: self._show_screen("gerber"))

Nothing about moving `gerber_dialog.py` into a package would break that line
loudly. Delete it, or reach the screen by another route, and the add-on simply
opens -- for everybody, including the customers who did not buy it. The suite
stays green, the app stays working, and the only signal is revenue.

So this file asserts the negative case once per feature key: with everything
granted EXCEPT the one feature, asking for that add-on must show the paywall and
must not open anything. It is deliberately written against `_handle_command`,
the rail's own entry point, rather than against `_open_<name>` directly -- the
point is that the ROUTE is gated, not that a particular method is.

The last test is the one that matters over time: it fails when somebody adds an
add-on to the rail without adding it here. A gate test nobody remembers to write
is the same as no gate test.
