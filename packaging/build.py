"""Build the Prism desktop app for whichever OS you run this on.

    python packaging/build.py                  # build + sign + archive
    python packaging/build.py --no-archive     # just dist/Prism*, for testing
    python packaging/build.py --clean          # wipe build/ and dist/ first
    python packaging/build.py --engine nuitka  # compile instead of freeze

Produces, in dist/:
    Linux    Prism-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz   (+ Prism-<version>.AppImage
                                                     when appimagetool is on PATH)
    Windows  Prism-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip
    macOS    Prism-<version>-macos-<arch>.dmg      (falls back to .zip without hdiutil)

Neither engine can cross-compile: whatever OS you run this on is the OS you
get. All three are built together by .github/workflows/build.yml, which runs
this same script on three runners.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TWO ENGINES, AND WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`pyinstaller` (default) BUNDLES the .pyc files. Anyone can unpack the archive
with a public tool and decompile it back to readable source in about a minute.
That is the state Prism ships in today, and for the licensing system it does
not matter — the security boundary is the backend, which cannot be patched
from a customer's laptop.

It matters for two other things: the routing prompts and the engine's
heuristics are the actual intellectual property, and a readable
`licensing/__init__.py` is a map of where to patch.

`nuitka` COMPILES to C and then to a native binary. There are no .pyc files to
extract and no bytecode to decompile — reading it means reading disassembly of
compiled C.

Do NOT read that as "uncrackable". It is not, and nothing is: the binary still
runs on a machine the attacker controls, and anyone willing to spend an
afternoon in a disassembler can find and flip a branch. What it does is move
casual inspection and casual modification from "minutes with a public tool"
to "real reverse-engineering work", and that difference is the entire, honest
claim.

The security argument is unchanged either way: a patched client still holds no
private key, so it still cannot obtain an authorisation lease, and everything
worth protecting is behind one.
