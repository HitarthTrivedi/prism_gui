"""Flatten a built app directory into individually-named files for hosting
as GitHub Release assets.

    python3 packaging/flatten_update_assets.py dist/Prism dist/update-assets linux-x64

Run by file path, same reasoning as packaging/manifest.py's own docstring
(packaging/ collides with the installed `packaging` library under `-m`).

Names each output file `<platform_tag>__<relative path with / as __>`,
exactly what updater.py's `_file_url()` builds when it goes to fetch one —
this is the CI-side half of that naming scheme, and the two must never drift
apart independently. The platform prefix exists because build.yml's `release`
job publishes Linux, Windows and macOS to the SAME GitHub Release: without
it, three platforms' builds would each have a file at, say,
`_internal/base_library.zip` — same flattened name, different bytes — and
whichever OS's CI job uploaded last would silently clobber the other two's
copy on the release.

Symlinks are skipped: they carry no bytes worth hosting, and the manifest's
own `symlink` entry (update_manifest.build()) is everything updater.py needs
to recreate one during stage_update() — nothing to download.
