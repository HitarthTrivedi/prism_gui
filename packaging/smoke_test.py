"""Launch the freshly built app and prove it actually starts.

A PyInstaller build that *completes* tells you nothing: a missed hidden import,
a data file that didn't get bundled or a Qt plugin left behind all produce a
perfectly clean build that dies the instant a user double-clicks it. That is
also the least debuggable failure there is, because a windowed app has no
console to print the traceback to.

So: run the real executable with PRISM_SELFTEST=1, which makes main.py build
the window, verify its resources, and exit with a status. Anything other than a
clean exit fails the build.
