"""The plan — what Prism is going to do, as a list of steps you can edit.

This is the workbench's centre of gravity and, before this pass, its emptiest
surface. One row per stage, each carrying the five things the design asks a
step to communicate:

    [number] [action] [description] [AI tool] [status]

and — this is the part that was missing — each row is genuinely editable.
The audit found the plan editor supported two of seven capabilities
(enable/disable, change tool). All seven are here now: reorder, edit the
engineered prompt, duplicate, delete and inspect as well.

None of that needed an engine change. `automation.run(custom_stages=…)` has
always taken an ordered list of `(stage_label, agent_name, questions)` tuples
and explicitly allows the same category more than once; the blocker was purely
that this panel handed back a `{stage: tool}` dict, in which order cannot be
expressed and a duplicate cannot survive. `selected_steps()` is the ordered
list; `selected_agents()` stays as the dict shim the licence gate still wants.

The other thing this file is careful about is *provenance*. Four different
things can put a step in front of you, and the design asks that they never
look alike:

    you asked for it      the tool was named in your own sentence
    Prism planned it      the router chose it
    Prism suggests        the router would rather use a different tool — and
                          it wrote a sentence saying why, which used to be
                          parsed, shipped across the thread boundary and then
                          thrown away
    you changed it        you have since edited, moved or re-pointed the step

The stage keys are the engine's own (research / brains / content / …); the
titles here are the human translation — a step is named after what it does for
you, not after the category it came from."""
