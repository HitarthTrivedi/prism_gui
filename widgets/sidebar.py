"""Left rail: brand, the two named nav groups, the add-on shelf, favourites,
and the pinned foot (wake word + profile).

The rail is a *shelf*, and it is grouped by what the user is doing rather than
by what the code calls it:

    WORK       the thing you came to start, and the two places that answer
               "where do things stand" and "what happened"
    ADD-ONS    the purpose-built runners — a product line, colour-coded
    (a rule)   Settings, which owns everything that configures Prism
    (the foot) the wake word and whose copy this is

Three constraints shape it and none of them may be traded away:

* **The budget is twelve controls and two headings, fitting at 768px with no
  scroll.** The rail had grown to twenty-odd controls across six headed groups
  — more choices than the screen it navigates to — and was cut back
  deliberately. It is at twelve here: New task, Home, History, Artifacts,
  four live add-ons, Settings, Favourites, the wake row, the profile row.
  Anything new has to displace something.
* **`theme.over()` for every white-at-alpha.** The rail's glyphs are rendered
  by handing a colour string to QSvgRenderer, and `rgba()` there is not
  dependable across Qt's SVG backends — a nav icon that silently renders black
  on navy is invisible. `over()` flattens the same pixel against the RAIL with
  no renderer to trust, and follows the role hue like everything else.
* **Everything is reachable from the keyboard.** Up/Down walks the rail,
  Home/End jump to its ends, Enter and Space activate, and every row shows the
  white focus ring `style.qss` gives `#navItem/#navSub/#railPrimary`.

Two things here are Prism's and not the design's, and both are kept:

* **Favourites** — the design has no equivalent. It is the only way to
  re-attach a folder you use every day without walking a file dialog, so it
  stays, at the foot of the nav where it does not compete with the add-ons.
* **The direct-jump settings** (`DIRECT`, below). They are also reachable as
  sections of the Settings screen, which is where the rail sends you.

# History came back into the rail in this pass. It is the fifth step of the
# app's own mental model (describe → plan → review → execute → RESULTS), and
# with it in Settings → More the rail had no way at all to say "review your
# work" — one of the five things the grouping has to make legible. It is paid
# for by BOM & Stock, which stopped being a button (see ADDONS).
#
# Artifacts is paid for by the slot Reel/Studio's own row freed when it was
# pulled from ADDONS — the budget is back to twelve of twelve. A generated
# file used to exist only as a path a dialog held in memory (gone once it
# closed) or a link into a tool's own hosted session (gone once that session
# ended); this is where it actually lives once Prism has saved a findable
# copy, and it needed a way in that survives every dialog that ever produced

#
# The tuple layout is unchanged on purpose -- key, label, icon, tip, feature,
# tone -- because four test files index it positionally and because

#
# ONE THING DID CHANGE: the 6th field is now a TONE TOKEN, not a colour.
# Holding theme.ACCENT here froze it at import time, before theme.apply_role()

# accent affected only some rows and was correspondingly hard to see. It is
# resolved by theme.tone() at the point of use below, which happens when the
