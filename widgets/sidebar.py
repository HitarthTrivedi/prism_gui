"""Left rail: brand, the two named nav groups, the add-on shelf, favourites,
and the pinned foot (wake word + profile).

The rail is a *shelf*, and it is grouped by what the user is doing rather than
by what the code calls it:

    WORK       the thing you came to start, and the two places that answer
               "where do things stand" and "what happened"
    ADD-ONS    the purpose-built runners — a product line, colour-coded
    (a rule)   Settings, which owns everything that configures Prism
    (the foot) the wake word and whose copy this is

Three constraints shape it and none of them may be traded away:

* **The budget is twelve controls and two headings, fitting at 768px with no
  scroll.** The rail had grown to twenty-odd controls across six headed groups
  — more choices than the screen it navigates to — and was cut back
  deliberately. It is at twelve here: New task, Home, History, five live
  add-ons, Settings, Favourites, the wake row, the profile row. Anything new
  has to displace something.
* **`theme.over()` for every white-at-alpha.** The rail's glyphs are rendered
  by handing a colour string to QSvgRenderer, and `rgba()` there is not
  dependable across Qt's SVG backends — a nav icon that silently renders black
  on navy is invisible. `over()` flattens the same pixel against the RAIL with
  no renderer to trust, and follows the role hue like everything else.
* **Everything is reachable from the keyboard.** Up/Down walks the rail,
  Home/End jump to its ends, Enter and Space activate, and every row shows the
  white focus ring `style.qss` gives `#navItem/#navSub/#railPrimary`.

Two things here are Prism's and not the design's, and both are kept:

* **Favourites** — the design has no equivalent. It is the only way to
  re-attach a folder you use every day without walking a file dialog, so it
  stays, at the foot of the nav where it does not compete with the add-ons.
* **The direct-jump settings** (`DIRECT`, below). They are also reachable as
  sections of the Settings screen, which is where the rail sends you.
