"""Help & support — local answers first, with a human route when needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Three tiers, in this order, and the order is the whole design
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    1. the written answers   (`support_kb.py` — instant, free, always right)
    2. live diagnosis        (their own Groq key, only when they ask for it)
    3. our team              (an email that already contains everything we
                              would otherwise have to ask for)

The answer book is deliberately local: ordinary Help searches never send a
question to Groq, an AI tool, or an Alphakore server. A customer can then opt
into live diagnosis for an error or stalled task; it uses their saved Groq key,
the written guide and a scrubbed recent Prism log. Questions without a safe
answer still go to the team rather than being guessed at.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why the gate is not a wall
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A gate that traps someone is worse than no gate. Somebody whose problem is
genuinely not in the book must not be made to read six irrelevant answers to
earn the right to speak to a human. So it opens on the FIRST honest miss:
they read an answer and pressed "No, still stuck", or they typed a question
there was no answer for. One of either is enough.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two columns, because a menu is not a conversation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The first version put everything in the thread: ten topic chips floating over
an empty screen, and a question box exiled to the bottom of it. Nothing about
the shape said "there are seventy-one answers in here", and the only way to
find out what a topic contained was to open it and lose your place.

So the screen is now split, and the split is the fix:

  · LEFT — the book. Search across every written answer, then the ten topics
    with the number of answers in each and the line that says what is on that
    shelf. It never scrolls away, so browsing costs nothing and going back
    costs nothing. This is where the topics live now; they are no longer
    posted into the thread.
  · RIGHT — the conversation. It opens on the questions the rest of the book
    points back at most, as pressable rows rather than behind a chip, and it
    keeps the three rules the first redesign earned:

      · **A menu is retired the moment the conversation moves past it.** The
        pick is already echoed as the customer's own bubble, so nothing is
        lost — and live buttons left in the scrollback are how a conversation
        forks. (The did-this-help row collapses itself for the same reason.)
      · **Questions stay full-width rows**, because they are whole sentences
        and a truncated question cannot be chosen.
      · **Prism's messages carry its mark.** Two voices in one column need
        telling apart faster than reading them.

This is a SCREEN, not a dialog — it keeps its conversation for the life of
the window, so following an answer's button to Settings and coming back
lands on the same thread. Start over is the one control that forgets.

You are Lumi, Prism's diagnostic assistant. You help a customer recover from a

RULES
1. Use only the Prism reference material, the scrubbed recent log, and the
   stated machine facts below. If they do not identify a safe next step, say
   so and direct the customer to Contact support. Never invent a button,
   setting, error cause or successful repair.
2. Explain the likely cause in plain English, then give at most six numbered
   steps. Start each step with an action word.
3. You cannot click, change, retry or repair anything yourself. Be clear
   about that; offer the customer a real action button where one is supplied.
4. Do not expose API keys, passwords, raw logs, stack traces, technical error
   codes, prompts, tokens, JSON, selectors, or browser-driver details.
5. If a reference answer has an Action key, append exactly this on a new last
   line: [ACTION: key]. Only use an action key actually shown in the material.
