"""Settings, as a grouped section list in a focused modal.

The design folds the rail's old WORKSPACE and CONFIGURE groups — nine separate
rows, each opening the same dialog scrolled to a different place — into a single
page. This is that page.

Editing happens right here, not in a second dialog. There used to be a
SetupDialog with its own left-hand index of the same eight-ish sections, under
different names and a different order, that every "Change…" button on this
page opened — so a customer browsed one nav to find the fact, then landed in a
second, disagreeing nav to change it, then had to Save/Cancel back out to see
whether it took. That dialog is gone; every field it owned (the Groq key, the
agent picks, both languages, the Chrome pin, the workspace root, the
designation key, the team roster) now lives inline in the matching section
below, each with its own small Save so one field's mistake can't block
another's. The one thing still genuinely a separate flow is entering a new
licence key — LicenseDialog validates and activates in a way this page has no
reason to duplicate, so the licence section still opens it, directly, with no
detour through a scrolled-to section first.

What this screen owns outright, because nothing else offers it:

* **The licence in full** — who it is for, which plan, what that plan includes
  and what it does not, and the two irreversible actions (change the key,
  release this computer's seat), quarantined in their own red group.
* **Privacy & data** — where a member's work is actually written, who else can
  read it, and every folder Prism keeps, with doors to open them.
* **Diagnostics** — what this machine can and cannot do, the licence lease
  state, and the tail of the log, plus the export a support call needs. All of
  it was reachable only from a button in the Setup dialog's footer.
* **Login tabs** and the **"Set your name"** flow — an action rather than a
  setting, but Settings is where you go when something is not connected, and a
  solo install has no other route to a display name at all.

Sections that are NOT here, and why: there is no notification system in the
product (nothing schedules, raises or stores one), so a Notifications page
would be a page of dead switches. Appearance has exactly one honest control —
card shadows — which is folded into Diagnostics beside the other
renderer-dependent facts rather than given a page of its own.
