"""The run console — what Prism is doing right now, step by step.

Execution is the moment the whole product exists for: a browser is being
driven somewhere off-screen for tens of minutes and this panel is the only
window onto it. It used to be a heading, a sub-caption and a column of cards
that said "Working… 2s" — a screen that was half empty at the exact point the
user most wanted to be told something.

Two things changed.

**A run header.** Task, overall state, step counter, elapsed and progress, with
Stop beside them. None of that existed; every number in it was already known
somewhere else in the app (Home was even being handed the step counter) and
none of it reached the screen where the run is.

**The engine's own words.** The audit found that `automation.py` emits far more
than this panel drew. `stage_done` carries `blocked` — a human-readable reason
a step came back empty ("this tool has run out", "this is a sign-in wall",
"the site changed its markup") — plus `exhausted`, `count` and `snippet`.
`stage_failover` carries the real `reason` a tool was swapped out.
`stage_recovered` names the tool that gave up first. And three kinds —
`stage_skipped`, `retry`, `reel_scene` — were emitted and silently dropped,
`stage_skipped` having been added to the engine *specifically* so the GUI
would stop losing a step. All of it is rendered here now. Nothing on this
screen is invented; every line is a field the engine already produced.

Per-stage copy still matters: if a later stage fails, the user can take the
last good text and finish by hand.
