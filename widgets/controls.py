"""The shared component module. Everything a screen is built out of lives here.

Two jobs, and the second one is now the bigger of the two.

The first is the original: three shapes in the design have no Qt equivalent to
style — the sliding switch, the tool chip with its filled initial-badge, and
the small filled check-square used as a step marker — so they are painted here
against the same tokens style.qss uses.

The second is consolidation. The component census found six recipes for a white
rounded panel, four mechanisms for a status tag, six empty states and the same
`_label` helper defined identically in four separate panels. None of that was
anyone reinventing things for fun: the shared version either did not exist, or
existed somewhere a panel could not reach it. So the rule for this module is
that if two screens need the same thing, the thing belongs here — and if you
are about to write a fifth `_label`, use `label()` below instead.

A component here is expected to earn its place by being obviously easier than
hand-rolling one. That means: a docstring saying what it is for and which
screen needs it, sane defaults, every interactive part keyboard-reachable with
a visible focus ring, and a minimum target height of 28px. COMPONENTS.md in the
redesign scratchpad is the index.

Tokens come from theme.py — never a literal hex, never a bare pixel size. The
accent rotation is a blunt string replace over eleven fixed hexes, so an
off-palette blue written here will not rotate and will strand one permanently
blue element in an otherwise green copy."""

    virtual machines, remote desktop, older drivers) it produces nothing at

    the screen shows correctly-sized gaps where the content should be, while

    graphics fault, which is what made it so hard to report.

    A soft shadow is not worth that. Cards now read as cards from their white
    fill and hairline border, which are ordinary QSS and paint everywhere,
    and the design's own predecessor used hairline borders anyway.

    that draws the whole widget, background and children included. On software
    rasterisers, virtual machines, remote desktop and older drivers that
    pipeline produces nothing at all.

    A drop shadow that fails to render costs you a shadow. A
    QGraphicsOpacityEffect that fails to render costs you the widget: the
    animation starts at opacity 0.0 and drives it to 1.0, so if the effect
    never paints, the card is present, correctly sized, laid out, and
    completely invisible — permanently. That is live in the app today. Every
    StageCard on the run screen fades in from a QGraphicsOpacityEffect, so on
    such a machine a customer watching a nine-stage run sees nine
    correctly-sized blank gaps and concludes the app lost their work.

    Use this to gate the animation, not to gate the widget:

        if controls.effects_enabled():
            card.setGraphicsEffect(fade)
            anim.start()

    The ink comes from theme.TAG_TONES, which is the same table style.qss uses
    for the #tagXxx rules this class also applies. That is the fix for a real
    bug: the two used to be separate, and they disagreed for two of the five
    tones. A `tagWarn` chip painted its text NEUTRAL[600] grey while the
    stylesheet gave the frame an amber fill, and a `tagOk` chip painted its
    text accent blue on a green fill — so the one class built specifically to
    show a status rendered the wrong ink for its own tone, while the plain
    QLabel it duplicates got the right one. One table now, read at paint time,
    so it cannot drift again.

    were four separate mechanisms and no two of them agreed on what "done"
    looked like.

    Everything it renders comes from theme.STATUS, so a state has one label,
    one ink, one tint and one dot everywhere it appears. The state name is
    forgiving — "Done", "done" and "completed" are the same row (theme.status)
    — because the engine, the run screen and History each grew their own

    Two states you might expect are deliberately absent: `paused` and
    `waiting-for-user`. The engine cannot produce either — there is no pause
    primitive and no mid-run callback that can block on a human — so there is
