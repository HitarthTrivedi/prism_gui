"""Home — the command centre Prism opens on.

Prism used to open straight onto an empty composer. That is the right screen
for someone who already knows what they want to type, and the wrong one for
everybody else: it answers "what do I do now" with a blank box, and says
nothing about what the app has already done for you.

So Home is a report, and it answers six questions in order:

    what can I do      the hero, with the one primary action on the screen
    what is running    the active-run section, pushed in live by the window
    how did it go      four figures over the runs this workspace actually has
    what happened      recent activity, then the add-ons you own
    what is connected  which tool each pipeline stage is set up to drive
    how do I start     "Describe a task", and three quick-starts beside it

Every figure comes out of dashboard_data, which reads the real run records and
the real inquiry register. Where a store is empty the card says so plainly
instead of showing a zero that looks like data.

Two things this file is deliberately careful about, because both have bitten:

**Nothing here may report its full text width as its minimum.** A plain QLabel
does, and one 143-character run title (there is a real one in the shipped
data) dragged Home's inner widget out to 1391px inside a 1200px viewport — so
the third figure and the whole add-ons column were clipped off the right edge
of the window, with the horizontal scrollbar switched off to hide it. Worse,
it came and went with whatever happened to be in the runs folder that hour, so
it looked like an intermittent fault rather than a missing `elidedText` call.
Anything that renders user data on this screen goes through `_Elided`.

**A "failed" run and a run that never started are different events.** 86 of the
102 records in the shipped workspace have no query, no tools and
`"error": "Chrome would not launch"` — they are the same environment fault
recorded 86 times, not 86 failed jobs. Rendering four of them as "Untitled task
· Failed" makes the product look broken and buries the one run that did work.
They are counted and named separately here, never hidden. See `_split()`.

    is a read-only report over two stores, and a rebuild is far easier to keep
    correct than a dozen setText() paths that each have to remember the empty
    case.

    With ONE exception, and it is the reason the run section has its own host
    widget. refresh() costs a read of the register CSV plus a walk of the runs
    folder, and on a company install both live on a shared drive. set_active()
    is called from the window on every `stage_started`, so a nine-stage run was
    paying that whole cost nine times — synchronously, on the UI thread. That
    is the "it freezes for a few seconds every time it moves to the next step"
    report, and it is worst over VPN or a Drive-for-Desktop mount where a
    blocked stat is not interruptible. A run in flight changes one card, so
    set_active() repaints one card and touches neither store.

    The screen is a fixed PageHeader over a scrolling body, which is the
    standard page scaffold: the greeting and the way out to History stay put
    while the report scrolls under them.
