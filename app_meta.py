# Where the "Download" button on the update banner sends people, and where a
# person downloads a newer Prism from manually. A fixed vendor address baked
# into the build — never a URL the licence server hands us, so nothing that
# can talk to the client can redirect it (updater.py). The GitHub Releases
# page always shows the newest build; the CI workflow publishes every tag
# there.
# TODO(alphakore): point at WEBSITE + "/prism/download" once that page exists.

# Shown on every licence screen — when a trial ends, when an add-on is locked,
