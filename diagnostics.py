"""A log, and a button that packages it up.

When a customer says "it didn't work", there is currently nothing to ask them
for. A windowed macOS build has no console at all; the engine's status
messages go to a label that disappears with the window. So a support
conversation is a non-technical person describing a screen from memory.

Two small pieces fix that:

  · every message the engine already emits is mirrored to a rolling file in
    ~/.prism/logs, alongside anything that crashes;
  · Settings → Export diagnostics writes a single .txt the customer can email.

The engine has emitted its whole narrative through one function since the GUI
was built — `core.ui.set_sink()` — so this needs no new instrumentation
anywhere. It just points that sink at a file as well as at the window.

What the export must never contain
──────────────────────────────────
The Groq API key, the SMTP password, and the licence token are all in the
files this sits next to, and a customer emailing a diagnostics bundle has no
way to check what is in it. Everything written here goes through `_scrub()`,
and the export lists config KEYS with values redacted rather than the config
itself. The one identifier kept in full is the device fingerprint, because it
is what you need to release a seat and it is not a secret.
