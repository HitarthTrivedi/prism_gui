"""
Prism Sales Automation — Apollo: the same filters, asked of a real database
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Exa reads the open web and answers one sentence at a time; Apollo.io SELLS the
B2B contact database itself, and its people search takes the very facets Leads
& Outreach already holds — titles, seniority, person location, company HQ,
headcount, revenue. So the seller who brings an Apollo key gets their list from
Apollo's own index instead of from a prose query, with no second filter model:
`filters.SearchSpec` is still the only description of who the list is for.

What shapes every line below is Apollo's price list:

  · **Search is free.** `mixed_people/api_search` costs 0 credits, and it hands
    back no e-mail, no phone and an obfuscated last name — a catalogue card,
    not a contact.
  · **Revealing costs a credit**, one per person Apollo actually finds
    (`people/bulk_match`, ten at a time).

So the run spends nothing until the last possible moment. Everything that can
be decided from the free card is decided first — people earlier sessions
already pulled (`skip`, by Apollo id before anything else), the same person
twice in one run — and everything Apollo itself can narrow is pushed into the
SEARCH parameters, above all the location: Apollo has no exclusion parameter at
all, so "anywhere except India" is sent as the ~200 country names that are left
(`places.regions_outside`), and an Indian never reaches a credit in the first
place. Only what Apollo cannot express — an excluded job title, company or
keyword, and the bands it can only approximate — is enforced after the reveal
(`filters.match_person` / `filters.match_company`), and those people are
counted in `stats["filtered"]` so the owner can see what the credits bought.

And because that last kind of filtering happens AFTER the money is spent, the
run carries a `budget` — the credits it may spend, `target` by default, so the
rail's "Reveal up to 300" is 300 credits and not a hope. Without one, an
exclusion Apollo cannot express (nine "Sales Plant Heads" for every "Plant
Head") leaves the target as far off after each reveal as before it, and the
run would pay its way down the whole index chasing a number it can never
reach. Hitting the budget ends the run and is reported as `stats["short_by"]`,
next to the `stats["filtered"]` counts that say where the credits went.

BYO-key and stdlib-plus-requests: `requests` is imported lazily through
`_requests()` so a test can stand in for the whole network, and every failure
Apollo can return becomes an `ApolloError` written for the owner, not a stack
trace.
