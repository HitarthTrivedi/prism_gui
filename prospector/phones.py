Prism Sales Automation — a company's published phone number
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Exa's agent reads a company's own website and its directory listings and returns
the number the company PUBLISHES, with the page it came from. That is the whole
promise, and this module never says more than that:

  * it is not a contact database. Apollo returns a validation status, a type and
    a do-not-call flag with each number; nothing here has rung the number, asked
    the network whether the line is live, or checked a do-not-call register;
  * it is the COMPANY's number (a switchboard, a sales desk, sometimes an owner's
    mobile the firm itself prints), not a named person's direct dial;
  * what Prism adds is a strict reading of the number — a plausible Indian or
    international number in one canonical form, with the kind its digits (and the
    page) suggest — and the source, always. The app says "published, not verified".

One lookup is made per COMPANY, up to 15 to a call, and only for leads that have
no phone yet: everyone at "Acme Works" shares one lookup. Pooled (the default) the
licence server asks Exa with its key and charges credits per number found
(gateway.company_phones, the server's leads_gateway.phones); the developer's
PRISM_LEADS_DIRECT=1 asks Exa with the developer's own key. The number-reading
rules and the question put to Exa are the SERVER'S too — the two copies are kept
in step by their tests, and by this comment.

Stdlib only, Qt-free.
