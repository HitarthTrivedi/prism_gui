"""
Prism Sales Automation — verify: confirm (or scrap) the e-mail with Hunter
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enrich builds a PATTERN address (firstname.lastname@real-domain) and checks
only that the domain accepts mail — not that the mailbox exists. This stage,
when the seller has brought a Hunter.io key, closes that gap:

  1. Ask Hunter's Email Finder for the REAL address at the company domain — if
     Hunter knows the person, this fixes a wrong-pattern guess outright, and the
     finder already carries a verification status.
  2. If the finder draws a blank, VERIFY the pattern address we built — so even
     an unknown person's guessed address is confirmed or scrapped.

Two deliberate limits, both honest:
  · **BYO-key.** No Hunter key → this stage is skipped and nothing changes; the
    sheet keeps its free MX check.
  · **The qualified slice only.** Hunter's free tier is ~50 finder searches /
    100 verifications a month — nowhere near a 2,000-row list. So we spend it
    where a bad address costs a bounce and sender reputation: the hot/warm
    leads about to be emailed. An LLM cannot do this (it can't probe a mailbox);
    a dedicated verifier is the only honest way.
