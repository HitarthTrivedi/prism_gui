"""
Prism Sales Automation — the credit gateway
───────────────────────────────────────────
Leads & Outreach no longer runs on the customer's own Exa, Groq and e-mail
verifier keys. Every paid lookup — find people, look up a company, its website,
its recent news, ask the model, check an address, find one — goes to Prism's
licence server (prism-license-server, /v1/leads/*), which holds the provider
keys, charges the customer's pool of credits, makes the call and hands back the
answer. This machine holds no provider secret and never sees one.

How the rest of the engine uses it: it does not change. Each provider call in
source.py / enrich.py / signals.py / verify.py / qualify.py / reach.py already
took an `api_key` (or a `keys` dict); in pooled mode that key is the sentinel
POOL_KEY, and the ONE branch at each call site — `if gateway.is_pool(key)` —
asks this module instead of `requests`. Everything around the call (queries,
parsing, ranking, dedupe, the verify-then-find order) is unchanged and keeps
its tests.

  · `effective_cfg(cfg)` swaps the keys for POOL_KEY and drops every provider
    key the customer might still have in ~/.prism.
  · A run's spend is counted here (`reset()` … `used()`), because the calls that
    make it are threaded and deep inside the engine.
  · When the pool runs dry the server says so with INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS. The
    engine reads a failed lookup as "nothing came back" and would carry on
    asking, so this module remembers the refusal (`exhausted()`) and refuses
    every further paid call at once, without the round trip — a run stops
    within a beat, and the worker says why instead of guessing at a key.

PRISM_LEADS_DIRECT=1 puts the old direct mode back (the developer's own keys
from ~/.prism or the environment). It is a dev switch, not a setting: nothing in
the app offers it.
