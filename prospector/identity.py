"""
Who a lead IS, across runs
──────────────────────────
A lead reaches Prism by two roads, and the same person arrives with different
fields on each:

  • a sheet — a real e-mail, maybe a profile link, never an id;
  • the ICP search — a profile link and a name/company, but no e-mail until
    enrich GUESSES one (and verify may later replace the guess with a found
    address).

So a person is not one key but a SET of keys, and two leads are the same person
when they share ANY of them:

    e:<email>             every address the lead carries (email + other_emails)
    u:<profile>           the profile link, normalised (linkedin.com/in/<slug>)
    n:<name>|<company>    name + company, both normalised — the weakest key,
                          only formed when both halves are present

Pure and stdlib-only, so the sessions store, the sourcing loop and the sheet
path all ask "have we pulled this person before?" the same way.
