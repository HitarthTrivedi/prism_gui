"""Every add-on this build contains, and the only file that knows them all.

THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT RULE IN THIS DESIGN
─────────────────────────────────────────────
The imports below are STATIC and they must stay that way. A dynamic
registry --

    for name in os.listdir("addons"):
        importlib.import_module("addons.%s.addon" % name)

-- is shorter, prettier, needs no edit when an add-on is added, and is
COMPLETELY INVISIBLE to PyInstaller's analyser. Development would be
perfect. The frozen build would ship an empty shelf, in a windowed build
with no console to print the error, and the first person to find out would
be a customer. packaging/prism.spec already records this exact class of
accident happening once.

So: adding an add-on means adding a line here. That is the cost, it is one
line, and its merge conflicts are one line. It is the only shared file an
add-on touches at all -- which is the entire point, because the reason this
package exists is that every feature used to have to edit main_window.py,
workers.py, sidebar.py and simple_panels.py, and four people cannot do that
at once.

STDLIB ONLY, like the rest of the manifest layer: prism.spec imports this
module in a bare interpreter to compute hiddenimports.
