"""What an add-on IS, as data.

One frozen dataclass, and every field on it exists to absorb a table that
is currently maintained by hand in more than one place. Before this file,
adding an add-on meant editing seven of them and the app diverged quietly
if you missed one -- which has already happened:

  · widgets/sidebar.py ADDONS         5 entries
  · widgets/home_panel.py ADDONS      7 entries  (+reel, +motion)
  · widgets/simple_panels.py ADDONS   6 entries  (no inquiry)

Three tables that must agree, three different memberships. And where they
DO overlap they still disagree: Gerber's icon is "file" on the rail and
"grid" on Home, and BOM -- which shipped, is routed, is gated and opens a
real dialog -- is still described on Home as "Coming soon" in grey, because
that string was written when BOM was a placeholder and nothing made the two
tables change together.

STDLIB ONLY. No Qt, no engine, no theme. packaging/prism.spec imports the
registry in a bare interpreter to compute hiddenimports; a Qt import here
would need a display on the build box. `tone` is therefore a colour TOKEN
resolved late, never a colour: widgets/sidebar.py freezes theme.ACCENT/OK/
WARN at import time, and theme.apply_role() rebinds ACCENT but not OK or
WARN -- which is exactly why that staleness is invisible today.

`status` is separate from `feature` on purpose. The old sidebar overloaded
the feature slot with a SOON = "__soon__" sentinel, but "not built yet" and
"not bought" are different facts about different systems, and conflating
them means the day a thing ships you edit a licence column. Note that
nothing uses SOON any more -- BOM outgrew it and only Home was not told.
