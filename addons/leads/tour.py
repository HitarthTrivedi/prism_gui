"""A walkthrough that points at the real Leads screen.

The help panel (addons/leads/help.py) answers "what is this screen". The
Alphakore team read it and then still asked which control each paragraph was
about — a wall of chips, spin boxes and columns does not name itself. So this
is the other half of the same answer: a coach mark that dims the screen, rings
ONE real control at a time and says in a sentence or two what it does, walking
every filter, tag and action on the surface.

It never touches the thing it points at. The tour reads geometry and nothing
else — no ticking rows, no starting runs, no writing into a field — and three
things keep it honest. The overlay swallows the clicks that land on it instead
of passing them through (a tour that let clicks through would put "Find
e-mails", which spends a credit a row, one stray click away); it keeps the
keyboard focus on its own card, so Tab cannot walk on to a control under the
scrim for Space to press; and a step whose control cannot be found is skipped
rather than conjured up.

The copy lives in STEPS, one module-level tuple of (key, title, body) records,
for the same two reasons help.py keeps SECTIONS: a sentence changes without
touching a widget, and STEPS is a name devtools/extract_strings.py already
scans (COPY_TABLES), so every line reaches the catalogue and can be translated.
Keep the copy free of braces, angle brackets and semicolons — _is_copy() reads
those as stylesheet or markup and drops the string. The keys are snake_case
with no spaces, which is the shape that same function rejects, so they never
reach the catalogue themselves.

The keys are a contract with the SCREEN, not with this file. Anything that can
be pointed at answers

    help_targets() -> {key: QWidget}      or {key: (QWidget, QRect)}
    help_reveal(key) -> None              optional: open the fold, switch the
                                          tab, scroll the rail
    help_snapshot() -> object             optional: what a reveal may move —
    help_restore(snapshot) -> None        the tab, a fold, the rail's scroll —
                                          taken when the walk opens and put
                                          back when it closes

and `Guide` gathers every such part of one screen into the single owner this
overlay talks to. A key nobody answers today is skipped, so a step can name a
control that is folded away, empty, or not built yet, and the walk still
reaches the end.

Reveals unfold, switch and scroll — that is their job — so the snapshot is what
makes the walk leave no trace: the owner who hid the filters, sat on Sessions
and had two facets open gets exactly that back, whether he walks off the end or
presses Esc halfway.
