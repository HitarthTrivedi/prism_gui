"""
Leads & Outreach — the workspace (the "A" direction)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`LeadsWorkspace` is the whole surface: a tab strip over six screens —

    Leads · Sessions · Lists · Saved searches · Sequences · Analytics

• Leads is the dense cockpit (`LeadsCockpit`): a multi-select lead TABLE with a
  left rail (the workbench mounts its lead filters there, above the refine
  controls), a Net-new / avg-fit counter strip, a bulk-actions bar that rises
  once a row is ticked, and an on-demand right DRAWER carrying the dossier plus
  a stop-on-reply sequence preview. Rail, results and a docked drawer share a
  splitter the user drags; columns resize. Scan-dense list; depth one click away.
• Sessions is real — every finished run (addons/leads/sessions.py), reopenable.
• Lists is real — the CSV/xlsx sheets Prism has already written to
  ~/Documents/Prism Leads, as open-able cards.
• Saved searches is real — the filters the owner kept to run again
  (addons/leads/saved_searches.py), each a card with its last run, "Use
  search" and "Delete".
• Analytics is real — this run's funnel, deliverability and verdict mix drawn
  from the dossiers in hand, plus the count of addresses already reached (the
  suppression ledger) and the outreach guardrails.
• Sequences is an honest, designed shell: it shows the exact model it will
  hold, and says plainly that the scheduler lands next.

The cockpit is pure presentation + selection: it takes the qualified dossiers
the pipeline produced and emits a signal when the user asks to verify, export,
save or sequence the checked rows, open a session, or use or delete a saved
search. The workbench wires those to the real workers and stores, so the whole
surface is testable with no pipeline and no network — Analytics off the
dossiers passed in, Lists, Sessions and Saved searches off folders the test
controls.
