Leads & Outreach — everyone Prism already has, filtered as you click
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apollo's Find People re-answers every filter change from its own database, so
the table moves the moment you tick something. Prism's people come from Exa —
a search costs credits — so the owner chose (23-Sep-2026) the Apollo feel
without the Apollo bill: filters are instant over the people Prism ALREADY
holds, and fetching new ones is a separate, explicit button.

The POOL is those people, one row per person however many ways they arrived:

  · saved contacts (contacts.py) — CSV imports, saves, exports, sequences;
  · everyone every past run found (sessions.py), with the newest qualified
    dossier when a run qualified them.

Two people are one when their identity keys touch (prospector.identity) —
the same rule a run uses to skip someone it already pulled. A saved contact's
fields win (the owner saved that record); among runs, the newest wins.

`filter_people` applies a SearchSpec the way Apollo does — AND across filters,
OR within one — using the SAME checks a search enforces (filters.match_person
and match_company), plus what only a local pool can check:

  · Job titles with "similar titles" on: match_person lets an include only
    steer an Exa query then; here it is a real filter — a title carrying the
    words of an include, or reading as the same seniority and function
    ("Plant Head" ~ "Head of Manufacturing").
  · Industry and Keywords INCLUDES, which a search could only steer: checked
    against what the person carries (their industry, their account's, their
    imported columns); a person carrying no match fails.
  · …except the people a SEARCH steered by those same values found. Those
    three includes only ever steered that search, which then took whoever
    came back — so a person it found passes them here too (Person.steered,
    from the run's own filters). Without that, pressing Find new people
    brought back 300 people and the page showed the dozen whose Exa row
    happened to name the industry: the "why only 37?" of 22-Sep-2026 again.
  · Contact CSV import — the person carries one of the chosen import ids.
  · Account CSV import — the person's company (by name, or by the domain of
    their e-mail / website) is one of the chosen imports' companies; that
    company's own record then answers the company-level filters (industry,
    headcount, HQ) the person row never carried.
  · The "Search people" box — name, title or company contains the text.
  · Apollo's filters over the owner's own records: Stage and Lists (the
    contact's — Person.stage / .lists, from contacts.py — or their saved
    account's, accounts.py), included or excluded, and Custom fields (the
    columns a sheet brought in, on the person or on their account). Someone
    not saved has no stage and is on no list: an include fails them, an
    exclude lets them through — Apollo's net new prospects behave the same.

Total / Net New / Saved (`split`) is Apollo's: Saved = saved contacts,
Net New = everyone else in the result. `pick` is Apollo's bulk selection
("Select number of people", "Max people per company").

Qt-free and stdlib-only beyond prospector; the widget and the workbench build a
pool off the UI thread and filter it in memory.
