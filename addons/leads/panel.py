"""The Leads & Outreach screen.

The whole workbench, in the window — not a launcher for a modal. The rail shows
this panel; the panel IS the surface: a page header (title + the run's batch
actions) over the tabbed cockpit (addons/leads/workbench.py), whose left rail
carries the search and whose results fill the rest. The heavy widget is built
the first time the screen is shown, so it costs nothing at startup (MainWindow
builds every screen up front).

`opened`, `navigate` and `open_run` stay as signals because MainWindow wires
them for every add-on panel; this one only ever emits `navigate` (the "AI tools"
shortcut). It never opens a modal — including the "?" in the header, which
slides addons/leads/help.py over the right of the body (F1 does the same) and
leaves the screen behind it usable while you read.

Two things float over the body, both children of it and neither in its layout:
that help panel, and the walkthrough (addons/leads/tour.py), which the panel's
"Show me on screen" button starts and `start_tour()` starts from code. Because
they float, `resizeEvent` is what keeps them the size of the body.
