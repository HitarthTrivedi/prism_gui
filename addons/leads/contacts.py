Leads & Outreach — saved contacts (Apollo's "Saved")
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apollo's Find People splits every result three ways — Total, Net New, Saved —
and Saved is a real store, not a filter: the people you import from a CSV,
save, export or put in a sequence become CONTACTS in your workspace, and "Net
New" is everyone a search turns up who is not one yet. (Apollo's own words:
"Adding prospects to a sequence saves them as contacts"; "When you export
prospects, Apollo also saves them as contacts in your account".) Prism had no
such store — sessions remember what a run pulled, lists are files you export —
so this is it.

One file, contacts.json, in a folder the caller names. A contact is a Lead,
written exactly as a session writes one (sessions.lead_to_row), plus how it
got here:

    saved_at    when it was first saved (kept on every later save)
    updated_at  when a save last changed it
    via         how, in the order it happened: "import", "save", "export",
                "sequence", "list", "email"
    imports     ids of the Contact CSV imports that brought it in — what the
                "Contact CSV import" filter reads (see imports.py)
    stage       where the person is with you — Apollo's contact stages
                (STAGES, knowledge.apollo.io "Contact and Account Stages
                Overview"): "Cold" until someone says otherwise; sending
                them a message moves Cold to "Approaching" (advance_stage)
    lists       the names of the lists they were added to
    notes       [{"at", "text"}], newest last — the person panel's Notes
    tasks       [{"id", "at", "text", "due", "done"}] — the panel's Tasks
    history     [{"at", "kind", "text"}], newest last — the panel's Activities
                (Apollo: "a log of all interactions between your organization
                and the contact"), what Prism saw happen: "saved" (how —
                a VIA), "stage" ("Cold → Approaching"), "list" (added to),
                "sent" (an e-mail's subject), "edited" (which fields),
                "flagged" (as inaccurate), and "call" / "meeting" / "email" /
                "message" / "other" — an activity the owner logged by hand
                (LOGGED), with what they wrote

One person, one contact: a lead whose identity keys (prospector.identity —
e-mail, profile link, Apollo id, name + company) touch a saved contact's is
THAT contact, tagged again rather than saved twice. Apollo's import setting
"If contacts already exist" is `update`: True writes the incoming non-empty
fields over the saved ones ("Update the existing record"); False leaves the
record as it is and only adds the tag.

Rules this module keeps — the ones sessions.py and saved_searches.py keep, via
store.py: Qt-free and path-free; readers forgive, writers refuse; writes are
atomic, every read-modify-write holds the module lock; a damaged file is set
aside, a newer one is never written over.
