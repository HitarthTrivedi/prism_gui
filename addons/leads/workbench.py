"""
Leads & Outreach — the workbench widget
────────────────────────────────────────
The whole working surface as one embeddable QWidget, so it can be the full
in-window screen (addons/leads/panel.py) instead of living inside a modal. It
drives the tabbed cockpit (addons/leads/cockpit.py) — whose People tab is
Apollo's Find People (23-Sep-2026) — and every action: import, find, verify,
save, export, send — with the heavy work off the UI thread
(addons/leads/workers.py).

The People page is everyone Prism holds (addons/leads/pool.py: saved
contacts and every past run), filtered the moment a filter is clicked, split
into Total / Net New / Saved and paged 25 at a time — all free. The one
action that spends is Find new people, which says what it costs and asks
first. Import ▾ brings a sheet in as contacts or accounts
(addons/leads/import_wizard.py, contacts.py, imports.py) and never searches:
the import becomes a filter.

Who a list is for is set as lead FILTERS, Apollo / Sales Navigator style
(addons/leads/filter_panel.py): every facet includes and excludes, and an
exclusion is enforced on every person who comes back, not pasted into a query.
A set of filters can be saved and used again (addons/leads/saved_searches.py).

It PREPARES; a person presses Send, and only the value claims from the seller's
own file are ever made (prospector/reach.py). Sending goes one-per-person from
the owner's own account, through the same engine mailer the Email add-on uses.
