# Every worker that has been started and not yet finished keeps itself in here.
#
# A QThread that is garbage-collected while its underlying thread is still
# running triggers a Qt *fatal* — "QThread: Destroyed while thread is still
# running" — which aborts the whole process (a 0xC0000409 fast-fail on Windows,
# with no Python traceback to show for it). The trap is that a Signal.connect()
# does NOT keep the emitter alive, so a worker held only through its `done`/
# `failed` connections has an effective refcount of zero the moment the caller's
# own reference goes: a dialog closing, an attribute being reassigned to the
# next run's worker, or simply a local going out of scope. The next garbage
# collection then destroys it mid-run and Prism dies.
#
# Making each worker anchor ITSELF here from start() until its finished signal
# fires removes that whole class of crash: no call site can drop a running
# worker by accident, because the worker is never only referenced by the call
# site. The set drains itself — _forget runs on the GUI thread when the thread
# has actually finished, so the eventual destruction is always safe.
