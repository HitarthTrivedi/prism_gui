"""Prism in the user's own language.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How this works, and why it isn't Qt's own translation system
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The obvious route is QTranslator: wrap every string in self.tr(), run lupdate
to make .ts files, lrelease to compile them, and load a .qm at startup. It was
the wrong fit here for three reasons:

  · tr() only exists on QObject subclasses. Half of Prism's copy lives in
    plain module-level tables (sidebar.PRIMARY, agents_panel.STAGE_COPY) and
    in helper functions in widgets/controls.py, none of which are QObjects.
  · it would mean editing ~300 call sites across 16 files, and every new
    string after that would silently ship untranslated with nothing to catch it.
  · it needs the Qt linguist toolchain in the build, for a desktop app whose
    build story is already the fiddliest part of shipping it.

So Prism translates by VALUE instead of by call site. t() takes the English
string and returns the local one; install() patches the handful of Qt methods
that put text on screen so every widget goes through t() without a single
call site changing.

The safety property that makes patching Qt acceptable:

    A string is only ever replaced if it appears in lang/_catalogue.json.

The same setText() that draws "Start the work" also draws a customer's name, a
file path, an agent's brand name, and — through the output panel — whole
paragraphs written by Claude. None of those are in the catalogue, so none of
them can be touched. The catalogue is an allow-list, not a cache, and that is
the whole design. Run devtools/extract_strings.py after adding UI copy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Templates
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Value translation cannot see an f-string — by the time setText() has it, the
sentence is already assembled and matches nothing. Those call sites are
converted by hand to a placeholder form:

    self.count.setText(i18n.t("{on} steps of {total}").format(on=on, total=n))

which keeps ONE catalogue entry with the numbers marked, and lets a translator
put them wherever that language's grammar needs them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two different languages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Language" here means the app's own words: buttons, labels, dialogs. What the
AI tools WRITE BACK is a separate setting (`output_language`), because they
are separate wishes — plenty of people want Prism in Gujarati and their client
deliverable in English. See prompt_directive().
