"""What the dashboard screens show, read from the same stores the rest of the
app writes.

The design's Home and Inquiry screens are full of numbers — inquiries logged,
quotes sent, win rate, recent activity. In the design those are invented
spring-manufacturer data. Here every one of them is derived from a real store:
run records under the member's runs folder, and the inquiry register CSV the
Inquiry Automation add-on maintains.

Nothing in here fabricates a figure. Where a store is missing or empty the
caller gets `None` or an empty list and is expected to show an empty state —
a dashboard that invents plausible numbers is worse than one that admits it has
nothing yet, because the first time a customer spots an invented number they
stop believing all of them.
