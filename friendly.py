"""Turning what went wrong into what to do about it.

The person using Prism runs a business. They have not used an AI tool before,
they did not choose Selenium, and "HTTP 429" is not a sentence. Every message
they can possibly see goes through here first and comes out as three things:

    title    what happened, in five words
    what     one or two sentences of plain English, no jargon
    steps    the numbered things to try, most likely fix first

The rule this module exists to enforce: **never show someone a problem without
showing them the next action.** A message with no action is a phone call.

How it works
────────────
A list of patterns, most specific first. Each knows one real failure — the
ones in KNOWN_ISSUES.md, because those are the ones that actually happen — and
carries the words for it. Anything unmatched still gets a useful answer: the
generic entry ends with "send us the diagnostics file", which is the honest
next step when we genuinely do not know.

Write the steps as instructions to a person, not a description of a system.
"Open Settings → Chrome and clear the version box" beats "the pinned Chrome
version is inconsistent with the detected one".
