"""Swap a staged update into place — the one step in the whole in-app-update
design that runs OUTSIDE the process being replaced.

Nothing in this module downloads or verifies anything; by the time any
function here runs, updater.py has already: verified the manifest's
signature, checked it isn't expired, checked it's for a version newer than
anything seen before, downloaded every changed file, verified every file's
hash, and re-verified the WHOLE staged tree against the manifest one more
time. This module's only job is the mechanical part: get the running Prism
out of the way, move the verified tree into its place, and come back up as
the new version — or put everything back exactly as it was if that doesn't
work cleanly.

Why this can't happen inside the process being replaced: on Windows, a
running .exe and every DLL it has loaded are locked by the OS for as long as
the process is alive (see update-research-inapp-download.md §2) — nothing
running AS that process can rename its own directory out from under itself.
The fix used here, and by every serious self-updater surveyed in
update-research.md (Squirrel, Sparkle, electron-updater, Firefox), is the
same: something OUTSIDE the install folder waits for the old PID to exit,
does the swap, and starts the new build.

On Linux and macOS that something is Prism itself, relaunched with a hidden
flag in a new detached process — the folder can be renamed out from under a
running process there, so this is safe and it is the path the tests
exercise. See main.py's `--prism-apply-update` handling.

On WINDOWS it cannot be Prism, and for a year it was: the helper was
Prism.exe, started from inside the very directory it then tried to rename,
which Windows refuses while an executable in it is running. Every Windows
in-app update therefore staged perfectly, swapped nothing, relaunched
nothing, and left the customer opening the same version — with no log to say
so. The Windows path now writes a small script to ~/.prism/updates and runs
it through cmd.exe (see _WIN_HELPER), which is what
update-research-inapp-download.md specified in the first place.

║ This module was written and tested on Linux only. The Linux swap path    ║
║ (rename a directory out from under a running process) is genuinely       ║
║ tested here — Linux lets you do that, no special handling needed. The    ║
║ Windows and macOS code paths below are implemented per the design in     ║
║ update-research-inapp-download.md §2/§5.4, but TWO assumptions they      ║
║ depend on have never been exercised on real hardware:                    ║
║                                                                            ║
║   Windows: the helper is now an external .bat (the in-process one could  ║
║   never have worked — see the docstring above), but how long antivirus   ║
║   or the PyInstaller bootloader holds a lock on the folder AFTER the     ║
║   process exits is still unmeasured. Both the .bat and perform_swap()    ║
║   retry for ~60s before giving up and leaving everything as it was.      ║
║   ~/.prism/logs/update-apply.log now records which of those happened.    ║

║   (rather than downloaded via a browser) pick up the same Gatekeeper/    ║
║   quarantine treatment a browser download gets? Untested. (Expected not  ║
║   to: only apps that opt in via LSFileQuarantineEnabled tag what they    ║
║   write, and shutil.copy2 does not carry xattrs on macOS.) What IS fixed ║
║   is the unit being swapped — updater.install_dir() now returns the      ║
║   whole `Prism.app`, never `Contents/MacOS` (that rename gutted the      ║
║   bundle), and the pending marker sits beside the bundle, not inside it. ║
║                                                                            ║

Known scope cut (documented, not hidden): startup-success confirmation here
is self-reported — the newly-relaunched Prism has to run far enough to call
confirm_startup_success() before its next restart, or the next launch treats
it as failed and rolls back. This catches "the new version starts and then
crashes" and "the new version never gets past licensing/import". It does NOT
catch "the OS refuses to start the new executable at all" (e.g. a missing
shared library making the process exit before a single line of Python
runs) — that would need a supervisor process watching the relaunched PID's
exit code, which is deferred; see update-plan.md's Phase 3 list.
