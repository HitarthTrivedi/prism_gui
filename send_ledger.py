"""
Prism — the ledger of what has been sent from this computer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
One plain JSON file, `~/Prism Email/sent.json`, one entry per press of Send.
Both Email and Leads write it and read today's count from it, so a daily limit
set once holds for every way of sending (review finding 7, 2026-10-01: Leads
used to send around it). It lives at the top level, stdlib-only, so neither
add-on has to import the other.

`addons/email/sent_log.py` re-exports this and keeps the words for the table.
