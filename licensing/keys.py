"""Public keys that licence tokens are verified against.

Public keys are not secrets — publishing them is harmless. The matching private
keys live only in the licence server's secret store, and nowhere else, ever.

Rotation: tokens carry a `kid`, and this module holds a map rather than a
single key, so a new signing key can be introduced while tokens signed with the
old one still verify. The order is always:

    1. ship a build containing BOTH public keys
    2. wait until customers have updated
    3. only then start signing with the new kid

Signing with a kid that shipped builds do not know locks out every customer who
has not updated, which is the failure this map exists to prevent.

#
# A SEPARATE key pair from the licence keys above, on purpose — this is
# update-research-inapp-download.md §5.2 requirement #2, the single most
# important property of the whole in-app-update design. The licence signing
# key (`k1`'s private half) lives in the licence server's environment
# (Render), which is reachable by anything that can reach or compromise that
# server. A key that can make every customer's Prism download-and-swap-in
# new files must NOT be that key, or a license-server compromise becomes a
# supply-chain compromise. UPDATE_PRODUCTION's private half must be generated
# offline, on a machine that never runs the licence server or a CI job that
# can also cut a release, and stored the way `prod-signing-key.hex` is stored
# today (password manager + a sealed paper copy) — never pasted into Render,
# never into a CI secret.
#
# UPDATE_PRODUCTION is intentionally EMPTY. Filling it in is a one-time human
# ceremony (generate the pair, sign nothing with it from any networked
# machine, publish only the public half here), not something to do from a
# coding session. Until it holds a real key, no frozen build can verify any
# manifest — see update_public_keys() below — which is the correct default
# posture: a build that can't verify a manifest simply can't self-update, the
# same fail-closed behaviour public_keys() already gives an unknown `kid`.
