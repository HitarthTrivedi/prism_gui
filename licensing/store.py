"""Where licence state lives on disk: ~/.prism/license.json.

Deliberately NOT in config.json. core/config.py's save() rewrites the whole
dict from whatever the caller is holding, and the GUI keeps `self.cfg` in
memory across dialogs — so any stale copy written back would silently erase the
licence. That would surface as apparently random deactivations, which is about
the worst bug this system could have. A separate file also leaves the
prism_terminal submodule untouched, keeping the CLI a genuinely separate
product.

Every read here is defensive. A truncated or hand-edited file must resolve to
"no licence", never to a crash: the file is user-writable, and the one thing
worse than a customer losing their activation is Prism refusing to launch
because of it.

Nothing in this file is authoritative. It is a cache of things the BACKEND
signed — the licence token, and (in authorization.json, beside it) the
authorisation lease. Every field acted on is read out of a verified payload,
never out of the JSON. Editing this file can turn a working licence into a
rejected one; it cannot turn a rejected one into a working one.

The one exception was the licence key, which sat here in plaintext because it
is a reusable credential the app replays to heal a released seat. It now goes
to the OS credential store when there is one — see secretstore.py and
save_key() below.
