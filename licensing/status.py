"""What the app is allowed to do right now.

Step 8 of verification — the temporal part — plus the shape the rest of the app
reads. Kept separate from token.py because expiry is a normal, expected
condition that the UI has to handle kindly, while a bad signature is an attack.

The six states:

    none      no licence at all            → activation screen, nothing else
    valid     in date, server heard from   → full access to `features`
    grace     past the quoted end date but
              inside grace (paid, late
              payment)                     → full access + renew banner
    stale     in date, but our server has
              not been reached inside the
              licence's offline window     → blocked until it is
    expired   past end date + grace        → read-only: History and Setup only
    tampered  forged, wrong machine,
              or a wound-back clock        → read-only until an online refresh

`stale` and `expired` must never share copy. One means "we couldn't reach
Alphakore"; the other means "your licence is over". Telling a paying customer
the second when the first is true sends them chasing a renewal they do not
need, and costs a support call.

Read-only means the app still opens and the customer can still reach every
piece of work they have already produced. Only new runs and add-ons stop. A
customer locked out of their own past BOQ output does not renew — they file a
complaint, and they are right to.
