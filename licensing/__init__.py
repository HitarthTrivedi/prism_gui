"""Prism licensing — the whole public surface.

Everything outside this package imports only this module:

    licensing.state()                  what the licence currently allows
    licensing.has("boq")               entitlement check
    licensing.require("boq", self)     check, and show the paywall if not
    licensing.activate(key)            from the activation dialog
    licensing.deactivate()             release this machine's seat
    licensing.refresh()                background token + lease renewal
    licensing.authorize("boq")         may a protected operation go ahead?
    licensing.set_paywall_handler(fn)  wire the UI in, once, at startup

There is deliberately no start_trial(). Trials are keys we issue by hand; the
client cannot mint one.

Two rules run through all of it:

  · Never block the UI. refresh() returns immediately; the network happens on a
    daemon thread and the window builds against the cached token.
  · Fail toward the customer. Any unexpected failure in here resolves to the
    last state we were sure about, never to "expired". A bug in our code must
    not lock out someone who has paid.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE SECURITY BOUNDARY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Assume this process is compromised. Everything below runs on the customer's
machine, in a language they can read, from files they can edit; a determined
user can patch out any `if` in this package. Treat every client-side check as
a UX affordance and nothing more.

    LOCAL CLIENT (this package, and the app around it)
      · presentation — which padlocks show, what the banner says
      · workflow editing, local history, local settings
      · Chrome automation against the customer's OWN logged-in sessions
      · verifying — never issuing — backend signatures
      · deciding when to ASK the backend

    BACKEND (license_server/)
      · licence authority: status, expiry, revocation, seats
      · authorisation authority: who gets a lease, with which scopes
      · entitlements: the `feat` list a token and a lease carry
      · quotas and metering
      · every proprietary credential Prism owns
      · the Ed25519 PRIVATE key. It exists there and nowhere else.

The client holds only public verification keys (keys.py). That asymmetry is
the entire design: a modified client can lie to its own user about what it is
allowed to do, but it cannot manufacture a signature, so it cannot obtain
anything the backend actually gates — a lease, a protected response, a
proprietary credential.

The practical rule when adding a feature: if it costs Alphakore money or
exposes something proprietary, it must be gated by a backend check that
independently re-validates. `if licensing.has(...)` is never sufficient for
that class of thing, and is exactly right for deciding whether to grey out a
button.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TWO CREDENTIALS, TWO QUESTIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    licence token   (token.py, ~/.prism/license.json)
        "Is this Prism installation licensed?"
        Hours to days. Read at startup, offline, with no network at all.

    authorisation lease (lease.py, ~/.prism/authorization.json)
        "May this licensed client perform protected operations right now?"
        ~30 minutes, backend-configurable. Names its scopes. Checked before
        anything protected, and re-presented to the backend for anything
        genuinely valuable.

Splitting them is what makes Prism both instant and live. The old design had
only the token, so the only way to get a current answer was a blocking round
trip on every plan — up to 90 seconds against a cold host, with no offline
fallback at all. Now the token opens the app with no network, the lease covers
protected work for half an hour, and the network happens in the background.

    A lease is normally the FRESHER evidence — the backend caps a lease's

    licence at the moment it was issued, and that is why `stale` (token
    expired, licence fine) is deliberately absent here: a fresh lease is
    exactly the right thing to trust in that case, and refusing it would put
    the round trip back on the path the lease exists to keep clear.

    These three are different. In each of them we cannot establish that the
    licence is alive at all, so a lease that says otherwise is either a clock
    being wound, or a lease that was never ours:

        none      never activated
        expired   past the licence end AND its grace
        tampered  the token does not verify

    The order, and why it is this order
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        1. Local signed lease. Valid and in scope → proceed, no network.
        2. Missing, expired or out of scope → ask the backend.
        3. Backend re-validates licence, device, seat, revocation,
           entitlement, quota and client version, and signs a new lease.
        4. Cache it, and proceed.

    This replaced a design that went to the server on EVERY plan with no
    offline fallback at all. That was up to 90 seconds against a cold host
    before the customer saw anything, and one flaky connection meant no work.
    The trade it was making — live control in exchange for our availability
    becoming our customers' availability — is now paid for by a signed lease
    instead of by a round trip, which is strictly better on both sides.

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    What still always goes to the server
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Metered actions on a metered licence (PROTECTED_ACTIONS, and the lease's
    signed `mtr` flag). A daily allowance can only be counted where the
    counter lives; a lease says what a client MAY do, never how much of it it
    has already done. Prism's own pipeline is browser automation against the
    customer's logged-in sessions and costs Alphakore nothing, so only
    planning — three Groq calls — is in that set.

    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    The honest limit of the offline window
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Inside GRACE a metered licence can plan without the server counting it.
    That window is the backend-signed `off` claim (default one hour), so the
    exposure is bounded, per-licence, and adjustable without shipping an app.
    A local counter would look like a fix and would not be one — anything this
    process counts, this process can be patched to forget.

    Called at the START of a run or add-on — never during one. A pipeline is
    tens of minutes of browser automation, and failing it part-way would
    discard real work for a reason the customer cannot act on.
