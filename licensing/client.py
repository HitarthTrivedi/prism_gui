"""HTTP to the licence server.

Every call here is short, blocking and failure-tolerant, and the caller is
responsible for keeping it off the UI thread. A slow DNS lookup on a corporate
network must never add seconds to Prism's launch, and the licence server being
unreachable must never produce a dialog — the app already holds a token good
for days, which is the entire reason tokens are signed rather than checked
live.

There is no /v1/trial/start. Trials are keys we issue by hand; the client
cannot mint one. See docs/licensing/02-api-and-data.md.

# Where a shipped build talks to. Baked in at build time and NOT overridable
# at runtime in a frozen app — an env var that could redirect a release build
# to a licence server someone else controls would defeat the whole system.
#
# packaging/build.py writes this from PRISM_SERVER_URL so a test build can be
# pointed at a laptop or a LAN address without editing source. Leave it unset
# for real releases and this default ships.
#
# It must stay the DOMAIN, never the hosting provider's own address. The domain
# is the only thing that lets the licence server move — to another host, to a
# different region, off a free tier — without shipping a new app to everyone
# who already installed one. A build that hard-codes prism-license-server
# .onrender.com is welded to Render for the life of that binary.
#
# This was regressed once, silently, by a one-line change inside a commit about
# something else. Every customer activation in that build would have gone to
# the wrong host. tests/test_licensing_endpoint.py now fails if it drifts again.
DEFAULT_SERVER = "https://prism-license-server.onrender.com"

# Short on purpose. This runs at launch; if the server has not answered in five
# seconds we would rather carry on with the cached token than make the customer
# wait for a timeout they cannot act on.
# Background calls — refresh, deactivate, usage. Failing one of these is
# harmless: the cached token covers it and nothing is shown to the customer.
TIMEOUT = 8

# Authorising a run happens with the customer watching, right after they
# pressed Start the work. They will wait a few seconds for an answer; what
# they will not forgive is being told no because we gave up too early.
#
# Sized for a COLD SERVER, not a warm one. A host that sleeps when idle — which
# is every free and low tier — takes 30-60s to wake, and 15s meant the first
# run of every morning was refused for a server that was merely getting up.
# There is no offline fallback (see licensing.authorize), so this timeout is
# the whole difference between "Prism works" and "Prism doesn't" at 9am.

# up — and the second one lands on a warm instance a moment later.

# Renewing the token happens on a background thread that nobody is waiting on,
# so it can afford to wait out a cold server too. At 8s it could not: a host
# waking up ate the only attempt, the token stayed stale, and the customer's
# first click of the morning landed on "Enter a key" for a licence they had
# already paid for.

# Activation is the most expensive call we make — look up the licence, count
# seats, insert the device, commit — and the one the customer least forgives
# failing, because it is their first impression and they cannot get past it.
#
# Sized for a database that is nowhere near the server: a Supabase project in
# Sydney answers in ~300ms per query, so six queries plus a cold connection
# handshake is comfortably past five seconds. That combination produced a
# "couldn't reach the licence server" on a server that was up and answering.
#
# It is ALSO sized for a sleeping server, which is what the 30s here missed.
# The production host sleeps when idle; a cold /health was measured at 42.6
# seconds — comfortably past a 30-second activation, so the very first thing a
# new customer ever asked Prism to do failed against a server that was up and
# healthy. And activation is the one call they cannot go around: no cached
# token to fall back on, no way into the app, and their first impression is a
# licence they paid for being refused.
#
# 75s is the cold start plus most of it again. A customer who has just typed
# their key will wait; being wrongly told no is what they will not forgive.
ACTIVATE_TIMEOUT = 75

# Deliberately no retry here, unlike authorize().
#
# A timeout on activation is genuinely ambiguous: the request may have reached
# the server, counted a seat and inserted the device before the socket gave
# up. Repeating it can burn a second seat on a two-seat licence — and locking
# a paying customer out of their own second machine is a worse failure than
# the one the retry was meant to fix. The long timeout above is the answer
# instead; it removes the reason to retry rather than papering over it.
