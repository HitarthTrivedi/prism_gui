"""Rebuild lang/_catalogue.json — the list of English strings Prism can translate.

Why a catalogue at all, when i18n.t() could just translate anything handed to
it? Because it must NOT translate anything handed to it. The same setText()
that draws "Start the work" also draws a customer's name, a file path, an
agent's brand name and — via the output panel — whole paragraphs written by
Claude. The catalogue is the allow-list: a string is only ever swapped if it
is in here, so everything else passes through untouched by construction.

That makes this file the one place a new piece of UI copy has to be
registered. Run it after adding any:

    python3 devtools/extract_strings.py

It rewrites lang/_catalogue.json in place and prints what changed. Existing
translation packs are never touched — a key that disappears from the
catalogue simply stops being looked up, and a new key falls back to English
until someone translates it.

What it finds:
  * string literals passed to the Qt calls that put words on screen
    (setText, setToolTip, QMessageBox.warning, QPushButton("…"), …)
  * string literals inside the module-level tables that hold UI copy
    (sidebar.PRIMARY, agents_panel.STAGE_COPY, …) — these reach the screen
    through a variable, so the call-site scan cannot see them
  * anything already wrapped in t("…") by hand, which is how f-string
    templates like "Opened {n} tabs" get in

What it deliberately skips: URLs, stylesheets, object names, format specs,
and anything without a letter in it.
