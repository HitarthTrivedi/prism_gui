"""Sign and publish every platform's update manifest for one release, in
one run — release-machine tool, not CI, not a build step.

    UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX=... python3 devtools/release_all.py v1.4.0 33447658517

The `run_id` is the CI run that built the tag — `gh run list --limit 5`
shows it, or `gh run list --workflow "Build desktop apps" -b <tag> -L 1`.

This is the loop RELEASING-UPDATES.md's "Every release" section describes,
run once per platform instead of copy-pasted by hand three times: download
that platform's unsigned manifest and flattened update-assets from the CI
run, sign the manifest, upload both. devtools/sign_manifest.py is still the
thing that actually signs — this script never touches the key beyond
handing it to that subprocess exactly the way it already accepts it
(--key-hex, defaulting to the environment variable), and never prints or
logs it.

Deliberately NOT shipped (devtools/ is absent from packaging/prism.spec —
see build.py's own comment) and deliberately still a human running it on
their own offline signing machine: this automates the repetitive mechanics,
not the trust decision. Signing a platform for the first time needs
UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX already in this shell's environment — the script
refuses outright, with a specific "which platform, why" error, right at
the point it would actually need it, and never accepts it as a
command-line argument (a CLI arg is visible to anyone who can list
processes on the machine; an inherited environment variable isn't). A
platform whose signed manifest already exists on the release needs no key
at all — re-running this to finish an interrupted asset upload, or to add
a platform's release-assets structure after the fact, works without it.

TWO releases per version, not one — this is the real structural fix from
the v1.4.0 incident, not just a convenience wrapper:

  <tag>                    the human-facing release: archives, unsigned
                            manifests (from CI), signed manifests (from
                            here). updater.py's _manifest_url() reads this
                            one via "latest/download" — unchanged.
  <tag>-assets-<platform>  ONE per platform, holding that platform's ~1000
                            flattened per-file update assets. Created
                            --prerelease so it can never become GitHub's
                            "latest" release out from under the real one.
                            updater.py's _file_url() reads these via an
                            explicit tag, never "latest".

Why: GitHub caps a release at 1000 assets. Three platforms' flattened
files sharing the tag release with the manifests and archives blew past
that on the very first real 3-platform release (linux-x64 alone needs 966
once Playwright's Chromium is in the bundle) — 863 of those files silently
never made it onto the release at all, `gh release upload` still exited 0,
and nobody noticed until an actual update attempt was watched fail.

Uploads happen in small batches (BATCH_SIZE files per `gh release upload`
call), each one followed by re-listing what the release ACTUALLY has —
via the paginated assets API, never `gh release view --json assets`, which
silently returns an incomplete list once a release has hundreds of assets
(confirmed against the real API; this is exactly how those 863 missing
files went undetected the first time). Any file still missing after all
batches gets one more individual retry pass. This is slow — real, not a
bug in this script — but a dropped connection now costs at most one batch,
not the other 90% of a thousand-file upload silently vanishing.

Idempotent per platform: skips one whose assets-release already has every
file the signed manifest calls for, so a run that fails partway through
can just be re-run. Pass --force to redo a platform anyway.
