"""Sign an update manifest — release-machine tool, not CI, not a build step.

    python3 devtools/sign_manifest.py dist/manifest.json -o dist/manifest.signed \
        --key-hex "$UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX"

Deliberately a human running this by hand from a private key that lives
nowhere near CI or the licence server — see licensing/keys.py's
UPDATE_PRODUCTION comment for the whole reasoning
(update-research-inapp-download.md §5.2 requirement #2). The key never
appears as a literal in this file or anywhere else in the repo; it must be
supplied at run time via --key-hex or the UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX environment
variable, on whatever offline machine holds it.

Refuses to sign a version that is not strictly newer than the last version
this tool has signed, on this machine, for this manifest's PLATFORM — one
tracker file per platform tag (devtools/.last_signed_update_version.<tag>,
gitignored, tag read off the manifest's own filename), because one release
signs the identical version three times over, once per platform manifest,
and a single shared tracker refused the second and third of those as
"downgrades" of the first. The property this guard actually protects — a
release engineer can't accidentally re-sign an OLDER manifest for a
platform that already shipped a newer one — is the same "no accidental
downgrade" contract update_manifest.verify()'s expiry/monotonic checks give
the CLIENT side; it's just now scoped correctly.

NOT SHIPPED. devtools/ is absent from packaging/prism.spec (see build.py's
own comment: "devtools/ is NOT here, and must never be").
